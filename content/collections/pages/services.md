          We have undertaken dredging works in remote locations in Africa including marine
          engineering works (Groin construction, Stoppage of sedimentation etc) . We have
          specialized Equipments and qualified/ capable workforce for undertaking such
          works.
          Along with dredging we do also study the pattern of current movement and arrange
          to install Specialized Groins so to avoid further siltation in dredged areas.
